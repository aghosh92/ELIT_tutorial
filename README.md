# ELIT_tutorial

The goal of the tutorial is to give a hands-on experience of utilizing Ensemble Learning Iterative Training (ELIT) framework to discover atom features.

In particualr, the notebooks address the following:

(1) How to construct a training dataset from ab-initio molecular dynamics (MD) data for a supercell of graphene atoms.

(2) How to adapt ELIT approach to begin with training ensemble models using the simulated data, followed by using these models as baseline to adapt to experimental data. Here the goal is to find the carbon and impurity atoms present in the STEM image of graphene.
